All DB credentials are in config.php file.

There are two flags defined:
1) debug - when set to 1, will print out postmeta INSERT statements.
2) verbose - when set to 1, no INSERT statements will be executed but rest of process will run as usual.

If you want to see what the script will do, run like this:

http://localhost:8888/development/index.php?debug=1&&verbose=1
